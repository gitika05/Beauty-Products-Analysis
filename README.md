Project 2

This project on Beauty products is about the application of Keras functions in order to predict the review ratings based on the reviews given in the data set along with some data visualisations.

The data set is taken from Kaggle and it consists of data scraped from top brands such as Olay, Nivea, NYX Professional Makeup, Maybelline New York, Lakme, L'Oreal Paris etc. The file has 18 columns such as product id, review id , brand name, review title, review text, author, review date, review rating, rating count etc., for 295 unique product ids.
